<i>pyoomph</i> is an <b>o</b>bject-<b>o</b>riented <b>m</b>ulti-<b>ph</b>ysics finite element framework for <b>Py</b>thon. It is mainly a custom high level frontend for the prime functionalities of the powerful C++ library <a href="https://oomph-lib.github.io/oomph-lib/doc/html/">oomph-lib</a>. While pyoomph does not support the entire plethora of features provided by oomph-lib, pyoomph follows a complementary approach, allowing for rapid development and e.g. automatic nondimensionalization and advanced stability analysis beyond oomph-lib's native capabilities.
