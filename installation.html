        <p><strong>If you have a recent Mac with an Apple silicon (arm64) chip</strong>, you must run all commands in a <code>Rosetta 2 terminal</code>, see <a href="https://www.courier.com/blog/tips-and-tricks-to-setup-your-apple-m1-for-development/">here</a> how to set it up (note that recent systems must be handled as described <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/718666">here</a>). Also, please make sure to not upgrade your <code>mkl</code> package, i.e. enforce it to version 2021.4.0. Alternatively, you can compile it directly on arm64, but with the downside of not being able to use the fast Pardiso solver. See <a href="https://pyoomph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/installation/source/mac.html">here</a> for details.</p>

            <codebox>
                <p>python3 -m pip install mkl==2021.4.0</p>
            </codebox>

        <p>Make sure to have the <code>XCode</code> developer tools, e.g., by installing them via</p>

            <codebox>
                <p>xcode-select --install</p>
            </codebox>

        <p>and test pyoomph via</p>

       Compilation from source on Linux or Mac systems is described <a href="https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph/blob/main/INSTALL.md#compilation-from-source">in our github repository</a> and <a href="https://pyoomph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/installation/compile.html">our tutorial</a>.<br>
       Just clone our code
        <codebox>
            <p>git clone <a href="https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph.git">https://github.com/pyoomph/pyoomph.git</a></p>
        </codebox>            
       and follow the steps in the file <code>INSTALL.md</code> therein.
